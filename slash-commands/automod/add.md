# âž• Add

To add a new AutoMod rule, it's very simple: AutoTask is doing almost everything!\
First, create a sentence that should be blocked. Then, keep only the keywords. And that's almost it!

Use <mark style="color:blue;">/automod add</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">name rule log</mark>_\
Where _<mark style="color:blue;">name</mark>_ is the name of the rule\
_<mark style="color:blue;">rule</mark>_ is your keyword sentence\
And _<mark style="color:blue;">log</mark>_ is optionnal, it's the channel where AutoMod send a message if a message is blocked (recommended)

And that's it! You created your AutoMod rule!

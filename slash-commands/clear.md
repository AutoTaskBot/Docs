# ðŸ’¥ Clear

After a spam in a channel or something you want to delete, just use the <mark style="color:blue;">/clear</mark> command! It will delete a certain amount of messages that are less than 14 days old.

It is super easy to use! Just type <mark style="color:blue;">/clear</mark> and fill _<mark style="color:blue;">number</mark>_ with the amount of messages that you want to delete (_<mark style="color:blue;">number</mark>_ must be between 1 and 99).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to clear more than 99 messages, use the command multiple times :)
{% endhint %}

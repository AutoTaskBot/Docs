# Get any ID



{% hint style="warning" %}
You need to enable the <mark style="color:purple;">developer mode</mark> to copy IDs.



To do that, just go into your Discord settings then in Advanced and enable the developer mode.
{% endhint %}

To get an ID, just right click on the role/channel/member/server and click on "copy ID".
